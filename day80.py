The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N â€” the number of animals in the store.
The next line contains N space separated integers, denoting the type of each animal.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if it is possible that Alice and Bob end up with exactly same multiset of animals and NO otherwise.'''
